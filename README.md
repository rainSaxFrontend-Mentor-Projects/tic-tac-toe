## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project presented many interesting challenges to overcome. It gave me more practice with css grid and flexbox and a lot of practice writing javascript. In making this project, I used the CreateElement & CreateElementNS methods for the first time to make svg elements, and image elements dynamically in js. I also learned how to split a javascript file into multiple files and export and import variables and functions as needed.

### Continued development

For future development, I would like to see if there's a way to optimize the AI functions, perhaps with using dynamic programming or some other related approach.
